            <h2>About Taniti</h2>
            <p>Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. 
                While the island has an area of less than 500 square 
                miles, the terrain is varied and includes both sandy 
                and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush 
                tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that
                includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an 
                indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a recent 
                increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was 
                dominated by fishing or agriculture.</p>
